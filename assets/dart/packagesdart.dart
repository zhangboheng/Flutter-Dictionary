/*

A package is a mechanism to encapsulate a group of programming units. Applications 
might at times need integration of some third-party libraries or plugins. Every 
language has a mechanism for managing external packages like Maven or Gradle for 
Java, Nuget for .NET, npm for Node.js, etc. The package manager for Dart is pub.

Pub helps to install packages in the repository. The repository of packages 
hosted can be found at https://pub.dev/.

The package metadata is defined in a file, pubsec.yaml. YAML is the acronym for 
Yet Another Markup Language. The pub tool can be used to download all various 
libraries that an application requires.

Every Dart application has a pubspec.yaml file which contains the application 
dependencies to other libraries and metadata of applications like application 
name, author, version, and description.

You can use pub get command to install Dart packages.

/*

Dart provides an inbuilt support for the Boolean data type. The Boolean data 
type in DART supports only two values â€“ true and false. The keyword bool is 
used to represent a Boolean literal in DART.

Unlike JavaScript, the Boolean data type recognizes only the literal true as true. 
Any other value is considered as false.
